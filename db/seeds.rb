# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#

# can also load via 'Rails.application.load_seed'
# Examples:
#
#   cities = City.create([{ name: 'Chicago' }, { name: 'Copenhagen' }])
#   Mayor.create(name: 'Emanuel', city: cities.first)


# artists = []
# for i in 1..10
#   artist = Artist.create(name: FFaker::Music.artist)
#   for j in 1..rand(3..6)
#     album = artist.albums.create(name: FFaker::Music.album)
#     for k in 1...rand(6..10)
#       song = album.songs.create(name: FFaker::Music.song)
#     end
#   end
#   artists << artist
# end

#artists = Artist.all

# for i in 1..7
#   User.create(
#     email: FFaker::Internet.email,
#     password: 'password',
#     password_confirmation: 'password'
#     )
# end
